# Data Structures
___

This repository contains my Python implementations of various data structures (see [Data Structures List](#data-structures-list)). I have included unit tests to test the behavior of the data structures. This is part of a personal effort to understand how some of the most common data structures mentioned in Computer Science courses work.

## Data Structures List
* [Linked Lists](http://github.com/yumarg/DataStructures/tree/master/LinkedList) (singly, doubly) _includes definition of a node_
* [Stacks and Queues](http://github.com/yumarg/DataStructures/tree/master/StackAndQueue)
* [Binary Heaps](http://github.com/yumarg/DataStructures/tree/master/BinaryHeap) (min, max)
* To be continued..

[](Node, Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Stack, Queue, Binary Max Heap, Binary Min Heap, Hashtable with Chaining, Hashtable with Open Addressing, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Graph)
